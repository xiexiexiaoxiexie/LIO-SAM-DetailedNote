mapOptmizaiton.cpp:
    loopclosure: since keyframes do not contain pointcloud anymore, loopclosure detection need to cut the globalmap as  local map in order to perform matching.
    localmap generation: according to the robot localization, cut the globalmap reload the local map. This needs to be done as the robot is near the border of the last local map.
    initial position of the robot: maybe click on  rviz, right now  the initial position is (0,0,0)
    add scan context for outdoor loop closure detection
    the existed map is actually much bigger than the local map built by nearby keyframes, which make the kdtree search takes much longer.
